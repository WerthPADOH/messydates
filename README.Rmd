## Why this package?

Existing packages for working with dates in R expect them to be _tidy_.
That is, they should be in or coercible to the standard ISO format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

But dates are often **_messy_**.
Sometimes we only know the year when something happened,
leaving other components of the date _unspecified_.
This is often the case with historical dates, for instance.
Sometimes we can only say _approximately_ when an event occurred,
that it occurred _before_ or _after_ a certain date,
or we recognise that our best estimate comes from a _dubious_ source.
Other times there exists a _set_ or _range_ of possible dates for an event.

Although researchers generally recognise this messiness,
many feel expected to force artificial precision on temporal data to proceed with analysis.
For example, if we only know something happened in `2021`,
we might opt to replace this date with the start of that year (`2021-01-01`),
assuming that erring on the earlier (or later) side is more justifiable than 
a random date within that month or year.

However, this can create inferential issues when sequence or timing is important.
`{messydates}` assists with this problem by retaining and working
with various kinds of date imprecision.

## A quick overview

`{messydates}` implements for R the extended annotation standard for dates,
the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) outlined in [ISO 8601-2_2019(E)](https://www.iso.org/standard/70908.html).
These include standardised notation for:

- _unspecified_ date( component)s, 
e.g. `2012-XX-01` for the first of some unknown month in 2012 or `2012-01` for some unknown day in January 2012
- _approximate_ date( component)s,
e.g. `2012-01-12~` for approximately the 12th of January 2012
- _uncertain_ date( component)s,
e.g. `2012-01-12?` where this data point is based on an unreliable source
- _sets_ of dates,
e.g. `{2012-01-01,2012-01-12}` where the date can be both 1 January 2012 and 12 January 2012 
- _ranges_ of dates,
e.g. `2012-01-01..2012-01-12` for all dates between the 1 January 2012 and 12 January 2012 inclusive
- _censored_ dates,
e.g. `..2012-01-01` for 1 January 2012 or before and `2012-01-01..` for 1 January 2012 or after

`{messydates}` introduces a new `mdate` class that embeds these annotations,
and offers a set of methods for constructing and coercing into and from the `mdate` class,
as well as tools for working with such 'messy' dates.

Importantly, the package also includes a function for unpacking or expanding sets or ranges of dates
into all dates consistent with how the date or set of dates is specified or annotated.
Methods are also offered that can be used to make explicit how researchers convert date imprecision
into precise dates for analysis, such as getting the `min()`, `max()`, or even a `random()` date
from among the dates consistent with a set or range of dates.
This greatly facilitates research transparency as well as robustness checks.

## Installation

The easiest way to install `{messydates}` is directly from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("messydates")
```

However, you may also install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/).

``` {r git, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("globalgov/messydates")
```

Please see [the messydates website](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/) for more information about 
how to use `{messydates}`.
The package was developed as part of [the PANARCHIC project](https://panarchic.ch), 
which studies the effects of network and power on how quickly states join, reform, or create 
international institutions by examining the historical dynamics of institutional networks from different domains.
The PANARCHIC project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation ([SNSF](https://p3.snf.ch/Project-188976)).
For more information on current projects of the Geneva Global Governance Observatory, 
please see [our Github website](https://github.com/globalgov).

## Relationship to other packages

`{messydates}` offers a new date class, but one that comes with methods for converting from and into
common date classes such as `Date`, `POSIXct`, and `POSIXlt`.
It is thus fully compatible with packages such as `{lubridate}` and `{anydate}`.
