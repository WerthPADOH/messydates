Dates are not always exact. Rather, dates are often aproximations for
days, months or years. This is especially true for historical dates.
This can present issues for researchers dealing with uncertain dates in
R. The goal of `{messydates}` is to make available the extended
annotation standard for dates outlined in ISO 8601-2\_2019(E) to R.
These recent extensions to standardised date notation create space for
unspecified, uncertain, and approximate dates, as well as succinct
representation of date ranges.
