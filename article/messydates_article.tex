\Shorttitle{\pkg{messydates}: An R package for ISO's Extended Date/Time
Format}


\Abstract{
This paper presents the \pkg{messydates} package for R, which
facilitates working with `messy' dates. Messy dates are dates that
include some imprecision and do not easily fit within the standard date
format because they are historical, ambiguous, approximate, unspecified
or uncertain, or otherwise admit of a range or set of possible dates.
Messy dates are common when studying historical but also potentially
current phenomena. Oftentimes, researchers will elect to pretend as if a
messy date is more precise than it is to make it compatible with other
more precise dates and to use various tools of temporal analysis such as
event history analysis. The paper highlights these problems and offers
practical advice on how to solve them using \pkg{messydates}. The paper
also introduces a conceptual framework for resolving messydates into
more familiar date classes in R ready for analysis.

While there are several different

Messy dates include some degree of imprecision such that existing

Dates are often messy. Whether historical (or ancient), future, or even
recent, we often only know approximately when an event occurred, that it
happened within a particular period, an unreliable source means a date
should be flagged as uncertain, or sources offer multiple, competing
dates.

\pkg{messydates} implements for R the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF)
annotations set by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) outlined in \href{https://www.iso.org/standard/70908.html}{ISO
8601-2\_2019(E)}. The standardised extended format allow for unambiguous
interpretation of dates and guarantee interoperability. These include
notation for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  unspecified date(component)s, e.g.~\texttt{2012-XX-01} for the first
  of some unknown month in 2012 or \texttt{2012-01} for some unknown day
  in January 2012
\item
  approximate date(component)s,
  e.g.~\texttt{2012-01-12\textasciitilde{}} for approximately the 12th
  of January 2012
\item
  uncertain date(component)s, e.g.~\texttt{2012-01-12?} where this data
  point is based on an unreliable source
\item
  sets of dates, e.g.~\texttt{\{2012-01-01,2012-01-12\}} where the date
  can be either 1 January 2012 and 12 January 2012
\item
  ranges of dates, e.g.~\texttt{2012-01-01..2012-01-12} for all dates
  between the 1 January 2012 and 12 January 2012 inclusive
\end{itemize}

\pkg{messydates} contains a set of tools for constructing and coercing
into and from the \texttt{mdate} class. This date class allows regular
dates to be annotated to express unspecified, approximate or uncertain
date components, date ranges, and sets of dates.

The package includes functions for expanding sets or ranges of dates
into all dates consistent with how the date or set of dates are
specified or annotated. Methods are also offered that can be used to
make explicit how researchers convert date imprecision into precise
dates for analysis, such as getting the \texttt{min()}, \texttt{max()},
or even a \texttt{random()} date from among the dates in a set or range
of dates.

\hypertarget{motivation}{%
\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

Researchers often recognize this messiness but feel required to force
non-existent precision on data so we can proceed with analysis. For
example, if we only know something happened in a given month or year, we
might just opt for the start of that month (e.g.~\texttt{2021-07-01}) or
year (\texttt{2021-01-01}), assuming that to err on the earlier (or
later) side is a justifiable bias. Or they might opt for the end of the
time element because whatever they believe happened at least is known to
have happened by then. However, this can create issues for inference in
which sequence or timing is important. The goal of \pkg{messydates} is
to help with this problem by retaining and working with various kinds of
date imprecision.

\hypertarget{relationship-to-other-packages}{%
\subsection{Relationship to other
packages}\label{relationship-to-other-packages}}

\pkg{messydates} offers a new date class, but one that comes with
methods for converting from and into \texttt{base} date classes such as
\texttt{Date}, \texttt{POSIXct}, and \texttt{POSIXlt}. It is thus fully
compatible with packages such as \pkg{lubridate}
\citep{grolemundDatesTimesMade2011} and \pkg{anytime}
\citep{eddelbuettelAnytimeEasierDate2019}. \pkg{messydates} is,
therefore, compatible with all contemporary R packages for analysis.

\hypertarget{a-new-class}{%
\subsection{A new class}\label{a-new-class}}

\pkg{messydates} contains a set of tools for constructing and coercing
into and from the \texttt{mdate} class. This date class implements ISO
8601-2:2019(E) and allows regular dates to be annotated to express
unspecified date components, approximate or uncertain date components,
date ranges, and sets of dates. The function \texttt{as\_messydate()}
handles the coercion to the \texttt{mdate} class.

\hypertarget{annotate}{%
\subsection{Annotate}\label{annotate}}

Some datasets have, for example, an arbitrary cut off point for start
and end points, but these are often coded as precise dates when they are
not the real start or end dates. \pkg{messydates} helps annotate
uncertainty and approximation to dates. Inaccurate start or end dates
can be represented by an affix indicating ``on or before'', if used as a
prefix (e.g.~\texttt{..1816-01-01}), or indicating ``on or after'', if
used as a suffix (e.g.~\texttt{2016-12-31..}). Approximate dates are
indicated by adding a \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} to year, month, or day
components, as well as groups of components or whole dates to estimate
values that are possibly correct
(e.g.~\texttt{2003-03-03\textasciitilde{}}). Day, month, or year,
uncertainty can be indicated by adding a \texttt{?} to a possibly
dubious date (e.g.~\texttt{1916-10-10?}) or date component
(e.g.~\texttt{1916-?10-10}).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> tibble::tibble(Beg = as_messydate(c("1816-01-01", "1916-01-01", "2016-01-01")),

\hypertarget{expand}{%
\subsection{Expand}\label{expand}}

The `expand()Â´ function transforms date ranges, sets of dates, and
unspecified or approximate dates (annotated with `..', `\{ , \}', `XX'
or `\textasciitilde{}') into lists of dates. As these dates may refer to
several possible dates, the function ``expands'' these shorthands to
include all the possible dates implied.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> dates_expand <- as_messydate(c("2001-01-01", "2001-01", "2001-01-01..2001-02-01",

\hypertarget{contract}{%
\subsection{Contract}\label{contract}}

The \texttt{contract()} function operates as the opposite of
\texttt{expand()}. It contracts a list of dates into their abbreviated
annotations.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> tibble::tibble('Original Dates' = dates_expand,
+                'Contracted Dates' = contract(expand(dates_expand)))

\hypertarget{coerce-from-messydates}{%
\subsection{Coerce from messydates}\label{coerce-from-messydates}}

Coercion functions coerce objects of \texttt{mdate} class objects to
common date classes such as \texttt{Date}, \texttt{POSIXct}, and
\texttt{POSIXlt}. Since \texttt{mdate} objects can hold multiple
individual dates, an additional function must be passed as an argument
so that multiple dates are ``resolved'' into a single date. For example,
one might wish to use the earliest possible date in a range, or set, of
expanded dates (\texttt{min}), or the latest possible date
(\texttt{max}), or some notion of a central tendency (\texttt{mean},
\texttt{median}, or \texttt{modal}), or even a \texttt{random} selection
from amongst the candidate dates.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> tibble::tibble(min = as.Date(dates_expand, min),
+                max = as.Date(dates_expand, max),
+                median = as.Date(dates_expand, median),
+                mean = as.Date(dates_expand, mean),
+                modal = as.Date(dates_expand, modal),

\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{additional-functionality}{%
\subsection{Additional functionality}\label{additional-functionality}}

Several other functions are also offered in the \pkg{messydates}
package.For example, one can run various logical tests for checking
\texttt{mdate} objects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{is\_messydate()} tests whether the object inherits the
  \texttt{mdate} class
\item
  \texttt{is\_intersecting()} tests whether there is any intersection
  between two \texttt{mdate} objects
\item
  \texttt{is\_element()} similarly tests whether an \texttt{mdate} can
  be found within an \texttt{mdate} range or set
\item
  \texttt{is\_similar()} tests whether two \texttt{mdate} contain
  similar components
\item
  \texttt{is\_precise()} tests for whether \texttt{mdate} is precise
\end{itemize}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}

Additionally, one can perform intersection (\texttt{md\_intersect()})
and union (\texttt{md\_union()}) on, inter alia, messy date class
objects. Or perform a `join' that retains all elements, even if the
result would contain duplicates, with \texttt{md\_multiset}.

Some arithmetic operations are available for messydates. For instance,
one can add, or subtract, a day or one year to one, or all,
\texttt{mdate} objects in a vector.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> tibble::tibble(date = dates_expand,

Dates, even for some recent events, can be messy. Take the dates of
battles in 2001 according to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_in_the_21st_century}{Wikipedia}
included in \pkg{messydates}. The dates of these battles are often
approximate (i.e.~the day in which a battle started or ended is unknown)
or come from unreliable sources (i.e.~the date might not be
trustworthy).

\pkg{messydates} facilitates working with these dates as we can, for
example, check date precision, get the median values, and find the
longest battle in 2001.

R> as.Date(battles$Date, median)
\end{CodeInput}

Getting the timing right can be important for researchers. This is
especially true if researchers are looking to generate robust
inferences. Until now, when faced with date imprecision, researchers
usually have to choose between making arbitrary choices (e.g.~adding
``-01-01'' to non-precise dates) or work with imprecise dates (e.g.~year
only). Either choice may lead to biased results. Assume we are
interested in the relationship between the United States (US) being a
party to a conflict and the duration of the conflict in 2001. We
hypothesize that conflicts involving the US have a shorter duration
because of US military capabilities. Using \pkg{messydates} we create
two different variables representing conflict time from the 2001 battles
data to be our dependent variables; one variable with arbitrary cut off
points and the other variable with random values for uncertain or
approximate dates. As our independent variable, we create a binary
variable for whether the US was involved in the conflict. As a control,
we code the number of actors in the conflict. With these variables we
run two simple linear regression models.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> set.seed(1301)
R> battles <- battles %>%
+   mutate(arbitrary = as.numeric(as.Date(Date, max) - as.Date(Date, min)),
+          random = ifelse(is_uncertain(Date)|is_approximate(Date),
+                          abs(as.Date(Date, random) - as.Date(Date, random)),
+                          arbitrary),
+          US_party = ifelse(grepl("US", Parties), 1, 0),
+          n_actors = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2))
R> lm(arbitrary ~ US_party + n_actors, battles)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

Call:
lm(formula = arbitrary ~ US_party + n_actors, data = battles)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)     US_party     n_actors  
      8.815       10.802       -2.479  
\end{CodeOutput}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> lm(random ~ US_party + n_actors, battles)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

Call:
lm(formula = random ~ US_party + n_actors, data = battles)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)     US_party     n_actors  
      0.538       -1.410        1.660  
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Notice how the regression coefficients change and even flip signs in the
two models. Although not statistically significant, the coefficient for
US being a party in a conflict goes from being positive, when calculated
using arbitrary cut off dates, to being negative, when calculated using
random dates. In this case, setting arbitrary cut off points to dates
introduces highly influential outliers (see Cook's distance below).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot(lm(arbitrary ~ US_party + n_actors, battles), which = 4)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{messydates_article_files/figure-latex/outliers-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

Hence, it is hard to say whether there is a relationship between the US
being an actor involved in one of the battles in 2001 and its duration.
